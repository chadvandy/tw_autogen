---@class campaign_ui_manager
local campaign_ui_manager = {}

--- Creates and returns a new campaign ui manager object, or returns an existing one if one was previously created. This function can be used interchangeably with campaign_manager:get_campaign_ui_manager.
---@return campaign_ui_manager  campaign ui manager 
function campaign_ui_manager:new() end

--- Returns whether a ui panel with the supplied name is currently open.
---@param panel_name string panel name
---@return boolean  is panel open 
function campaign_ui_manager:is_panel_open(panel_name) end

--- Returns whether an event panel is currently open.
---@return boolean  is event panel open 
function campaign_ui_manager:is_event_panel_open() end

--- Returns the name of the first fullscreen panel that's open, or false if no panels are open. Usually only one fullscreen panel is open at a time but in certain circumstances (such as diplomacy) more than one may be open at a time.
---@return string  open fullscreen panel 
function campaign_ui_manager:get_open_fullscreen_panel() end

--- Returns whether the supplied character is selected.
---@param character CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE character
---@return boolean  is character selected 
function campaign_ui_manager:is_char_selected(character) end

--- Returns the cqi of the selected character.
---@param character CHARACTER_SCRIPT_INTERFACE character
---@return boolean  is character selected 
function campaign_ui_manager:get_char_selected_cqi(character) end

--- Returns whether a character from the supplied faction is selected.
---@param faction_name string faction name
---@return boolean  is character selected 
function campaign_ui_manager:is_char_selected_from_faction(faction_name) end

--- Returns whether a settlement in a region with the supplied name is selected.
---@param region_name string region name
---@return boolean  is settlement selected 
function campaign_ui_manager:is_settlement_selected(region_name) end

--- This is a mechanism by which client scripts can notify the ui manager that a scripted sequence has started, which registers "scripted_sequence" in the panel open list. This has the effect of making the ui manager think that a fullscreen panel is open, stalling any pending interventions. Avoid using this unless you really have to, probably the only case where it's valid is in the case of script that must work in singleplayer and also multiplayer.
function campaign_ui_manager:start_scripted_sequence() end

--- Removes "scripted_sequence" from the panel open list. This must be called after campaign_ui_manager:start_scripted_sequence.
function campaign_ui_manager:stop_scripted_sequence() end

--- Suppresses or un-suppresses an end turn warning from appearing. End turn warning names can be found in the table above.
---@param warning_name string warning name
---@param should_suppress boolean should suppress
function campaign_ui_manager:suppress_end_of_turn_warning(warning_name, should_suppress) end

--- Returns an incremental number which can be used for matching output between tabs.
---@return number  output stamp 
function campaign_ui_manager:get_next_output_stamp() end

--- Partially locks the ui, preventing the player from ending turn or moving armies and suppressing the events rollout. Subsequent calls to the function will increase the lock level on the ui, with calls to campaign_ui_manager:unlock_ui reducing the lock level on the ui. The ui will only unlock when the lock level is reduced back to zero.
function campaign_ui_manager:lock_ui() end

--- Attempts to unlock the ui after it has been locked with campaign_ui_manager:lock_ui. Each call to campaign_ui_manager:lock_ui increases the lock level on the ui while each call to this function reduces the lock level. The ui is only unlocked when the lock level returns to zero.
function campaign_ui_manager:unlock_ui() end

--- Enables or disables the event panel from auto-opening. Each call to disable the event panel auto-opening made with this function increases the lock level by one, and each call to enable it decreases the lock level by one. Auto-opening is only re-enabled when the lock level drops to zero. This allows multiple client scripts to suppress event panels at the same time, and only when all have relinquished their lock will event panels be allowed to auto-open again.
---@param should_enable boolean should enable
function campaign_ui_manager:enable_event_panel_auto_open(should_enable) end

--- Sets the campaign ui manager to save and restore the state of all ui overrides when the game is saved and reloaded. By default the state of these is saved - use this function to disable this.
---@param should_save boolean should save
function campaign_ui_manager:set_should_save_override_state(should_save) end

--- Enables the character selection whitelist so that it starts being enforced. After this function is called the player will be unable to select any characters that have not been added to the whitelist until the character whitelist system is disabled with campaign_ui_manager:disable_character_selection_whitelist.
function campaign_ui_manager:enable_character_selection_whitelist() end

--- Disables the character selection whitelist so that it is no longer enforced. Calling this does not clear characters from the whitelist - use campaign_ui_manager:clear_character_selection_whitelist to do this.
function campaign_ui_manager:disable_character_selection_whitelist() end

--- Adds a character to the character whitelist by cqi. The character whitelist system must be enabled with campaign_ui_manager:enable_character_selection_whitelist for this to have an effect.
---@param character_cqi number character cqi
function campaign_ui_manager:add_character_selection_whitelist(character_cqi) end

--- Removes a character from the character whitelist by cqi.
---@param character_cqi number character cqi
function campaign_ui_manager:remove_character_selection_whitelist(character_cqi) end

function campaign_ui_manager:enable_settlement_selection_whitelist() end

--- Diables the settlement selection whitelist so that it is no longer enforced. Calling this does not clear settlements from the whitelist - use campaign_ui_manager:clear_settlement_selection_whitelist to do this.
function campaign_ui_manager:disable_settlement_selection_whitelist() end

--- Adds the specified settlement to the settlement selection whitelist. The settlement name will be in the form settlement:[region_name]. The settlement whitelist system must be enabled with campaign_ui_manager:enable_settlement_selection_whitelist for this to have an effect.
---@param settlement_name string settlement name

--- Returns the button pulse strength constant (currently 10).
---@return number  button pulse strength constant 
function campaign_ui_manager:get_button_pulse_strength() end

--- Places a highlight effect at the position of the supplied settlement. An offset position may optionally be set - sometimes it's better not to highlight a settlement's central position if a character is stood there as it's unclear what's being highlighted.<br />
--- A marker type can be supplied - recognised marker types are currently move_to, select, pointer, move_to_vfx, select_vfx (default), look_at_vfx, objective. If one of these is specified then the marker is added with the underlying add_marker command provided by the game interface.
