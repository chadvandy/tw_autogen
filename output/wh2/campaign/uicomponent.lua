---@param uicomponent_address UIC_Address uicomponent address
---@param insertion_index number insertion index
function UIC:Adopt(uicomponent_address, insertion_index) end

--- Divorces the supplied child uicomponent from the subject uicomponent. The child uicomponent should be supplied by its address, which may be retrieved with uicomponent:Address.<br />

---@param child UIC_Address child
function UIC:Divorce(child) end

--- Creates a new uicomponent as the child of this uicomponent. A name for the new uicomponent must be supplied, as well as a filepath to a layout file containing a template for the new uicomponent.

function UIC:SetImageRotation(image_index, rotation, pivot_x, pivot_y) end

--- Sets a new image path for an image associated with the uicomponent, replacing the original image with something new. Multiple images can be associated with a uicomponent - the index of the image to overwrite can be set with the second parameter or by setting a "script_icon_index" user property on the uicomponent with uicomponent:SetProperty. If an index value is not set with either of these methods then the first image, image 0, is swapped.<br />

--- Returns the variables of the text shader currently active on the uicomponent.
---@return number  first value 
---@return number  second value 
---@return number  third value 
---@return number  fourth value 
function UIC:TextShaderVarsGet() end

--- Instructs this uicomponent to steal a game shortcut key, so that keypresses of that type are redirected to this uicomponent which will handle them. If a shortcut is stolen it must be released again at some suitable later time for the default keypress behaviour to be restored.<br />
--- Keyboard shortcuts are listed in data\text\default_keys.xml.
---@param should_steal boolean If set to true, the key must be specified as the second argument. If false, all keys stolen by this uicomponent will be released so no second argument is required.
---@param key_type string Key type to steal.
---@return boolean  success 
function UIC:StealShortcutKey(should_steal, key_type) end

--- Instructs this uicomponent to steal all keyboard input. All keypresses are therefore redirected to this uicomponent which will handle them. If input focus is stolen by a uicomponent then standard keyboard behaviour will be overridden until it is released with a second call to this function.
---@param should_steal boolean should steal
function UIC:StealInputFocus(should_steal) end

--- Triggers a keyboard shortcut on the uicomponent, by name. Keyboard shortcuts are listed in data\text\default_keys.xml.
---@param shortcut string shortcut
function UIC:TriggerShortcut(shortcut) end

--- Highlights or unhighlights the uicomponent to the player with a flashing ring. 
---@param should_highlight boolean Set to true</code to activate the highlight, or false to deactivate.
---@param square boolean Set to true to show a square highlight, or false to show a circular highlight.
---@param priority_lock number Activates a priority lock along with the highlight with the specified priority. While a priority lock is active, any interactive uicomponents with a priority less than the supplied lock level will be rendered non-interactive. See the Priority and Locking section for more information.
function UIC:Highlight(should_highlight, square, priority_lock) end

--- Activates a fullscreen highlight around the subject uicomponent. This places a nearly opaque layer over the screen except for a window over the subject uicomponent, leaving it prominently displayed. Text may optionally be specified that gets displayed over the opaque layer.
---@param highlight_text string Text to display over the fullscreen highlight. If used, this should be set to the key of an entry from the random_localisation_strings table.
---@param once_only boolean Displays this fullscreen highlight once only. If this flag is set, an entry is stored in the registry when this fullscreen highlight is displayed, preventing it from ever being displayed again.
function UIC:FullScreenHighlight(highlight_text, once_only) end

--- Activates a pulsing highlight effect on the subject uicomponent. This is useful for unobtrusively highlighting components with an area such as buttons and panels, but doesn't work so well for highlighting text. The script function pulse_uicomponent wraps this function.
---@param pulse_strength number Pulse strength override. A typical value might be a number between 1 and 10.
---@param state_name string State name. If supplied, this applies the pulsing effect to only the specified state of the uicomponent.
function UIC:StartPulseHighlight(pulse_strength, state_name) end

--- Deactivates a pulsing highlight effect on the subject uicomponent that was previously started with uicomponent:StartPulseHighlight.
---@param state_name string State name. If supplied, this stops the pulsing effect on only the specified state of the uicomponent.
function UIC:StopPulseHighlight(state_name) end

--- Calls an interface function on the uicomponent, by string name. Interface functions are provided by some uicomponents to allow the script to activate specific functionality related to the uicomponent. Along with the string name of the interface function, multiple arguments to pass to that function may be specified.
---@param function_name string Name of interface function to call.
---@vararg any
function UIC:InterfaceFunction(function_name, ...) end

--- Returns whether this uicomponent provides any interface functions.
---@return boolean  has callback interface 
function UIC:HasInterface() end

--- Simulates a left-click on the uicomponent. Relative co-ordinates at which the click is simulated on the component may optionally be specified. Both arguments must be supplied to specify a position.
---@param x number X co-ordinate of click on component.
---@param y number Y co-ordinate of click on component.
function UIC:SimulateLClick(x, y) end

--- Simulates a right-click on the uicomponent. Relative co-ordinates at which the click is simulated on the component may optionally be specified. Both arguments must be supplied to specify a position.
---@param x number X co-ordinate of click on component.
---@param y number Y co-ordinate of click on component.
function UIC:SimulateRClick(x, y) end

--- Simulates a double-left-click on the uicomponent. Relative co-ordinates at which the click is simulated on the component may optionally be specified. Both arguments must be supplied to specify a position.
---@param x number X co-ordinate of click on component.
---@param y number Y co-ordinate of click on component.
function UIC:SimulateDblLClick(x, y) end

--- Simulates a double-left-click on the uicomponent. Relative co-ordinates at which the click is simulated on the component may optionally be specified. Both arguments must be supplied to specify a position.
---@param x number X co-ordinate of click on component.
---@param y number Y co-ordinate of click on component.
function UIC:SimulateDblRClick(x, y) end

--- Simulates a mouse-on event on the uicomponent.
function UIC:SimulateMouseOn() end

--- Simulates a mouse-off event on the uicomponent.
function UIC:SimulateMouseOff() end

--- Simulates a mouse-move event on the uicomponent. Relative co-ordinates at which the mouse move event is simulated on the component may optionally be specified. Both arguments must be supplied to specify a position.
---@param x number X co-ordinate of event on component.
---@param y number Y co-ordinate of event on component.
function UIC:SimulateMouseMove(x, y) end

--- Simulates a keypress on the uicomponent. A string key id must be specified from the list documented at the top of this section.
---@param key_id string key id
function UIC:SimulateKey(key_id) end

--- Simulates a keypress-down on the uicomponent. A string key id must be specified from the list documented at the top of this section.
---@param key_id string key id
function UIC:SimulateKeyDown(key_id) end

--- Simulates a keypress-up on the uicomponent. A string key id must be specified from the list documented at the top of this section.
---@param key_id string key id
function UIC:SimulateKeyUp(key_id) end
