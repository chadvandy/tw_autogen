---@param mark_as_ally boolean mark as ally
function script_unit:mark_as_ally(mark_as_ally) end

--- Returns true if the unit is hidden in grass/forests etc. This is an unembellished wrapper for an underlying code function. Returned result is not related to the terrain visibility system, which came later than this code function, so a unit may not be hidden (according to this result returned by this function) but may still not be visible to its enemy - check also script_unit:is_visible_to_enemy.
---@return boolean  is hidden 
function script_unit:is_hidden() end

--- Makes the unit invisible. This is an unembellished wrapper for an underlying code function.
---@param is_hidden boolean is hidden
function script_unit:set_invisible_to_all(is_hidden) end

--- Modifies this unit's ammo to a specified unary proportion of its starting value.
---@param proportion number Desired proportion of starting ammo. Supply 1 to set the ammo back to its starting value, 0.5 to half etc. Values of greater than one are semi-supported - the command will work, but any ammo bars on the UI will show as full until the unit's ammo value drops below its starting value.
function script_unit:modify_ammo(proportion) end

--- Modifies this unit's ammo to a specified unary proportion of its starting value, but only if it has less than the specified amount.
---@param proportion number Desired proportion of starting ammo. Supply 1 to set the ammo back to its starting value, 0.5 to half etc. Values of greater than one are semi-supported - the command will work, but any ammo bars on the UI will show as full until the unit's ammo value drops below its starting value.
function script_unit:refill_ammo(proportion) end

function script_unit:cache_health() end

--- Compares the scriptunits current casualties with that when it was previously cached with script_unit:cache_health, and returns true if they're different.
---@param tolerance number Tolerance value. The casualties values is expressed internally as a unary value (between 0 and 1), so this should be expressed in a similar manner. Therefore a tolerance of 0.1 would allow for 10% casualties (of the original number of soldiers in the unit) more than when previously cached before returning true.
---@return boolean  has taken casualties 
function script_unit:has_taken_casualties(tolerance) end

--- Returns this unit's hitpoints as a unary of its initial value. If the shattered-considered-dead flag is set and the unit is shattered (or it's routing and has left the field), then 0 is returned.
---@param considered_dead shattered considered dead
---@return number  unary hitpoints 
function script_unit:unary_hitpoints(considered_dead) end

--- Sets the maximum number of casualties that this unit can take. If the unit's hitpoints drop below the specified unary value, the unit is made invincible so that it can no longer take casualties (note that it may still rout). Exception scriptunits can be set, so that proximity to those script_unit or script_units disables this invincibility (allow certain units to be perceived to charge in and 'save the day').
---@param unary_proportion number Call max_casualties with a proportion value of 0 to disables any previous max_casualties monitor on this unit.
---@param should_release boolean Set to true to release script control of this unit after max_casualties makes a change. Set this primarily if the unit is under player control.

---@param set_invincible boolean set invincible
function script_unit:set_invincible(set_invincible) end

--- Makes the subject unit invincible a proportion of the time. The intended effect is to slow the rate at which the unit receives casualties. Invincibility is toggled on and off over a five second interval, with the unit being invincible the specified proportion of time. The proportion is set as a unary number, so supplying a value of 0.8 would make the unit invincible for four seconds out of every five.<br />
--- Set a value of 0 to turn off any previous invincibility set with this function.
---@param time_proportion number Unary (0-1) time proportion over which this unit should be invincible.
---@param should_release boolean Instructs the function to release script control of the unit after setting it to be invincible or otherwise. Set this to true if the scriptunit is player-controlled.
function script_unit:set_invincible_for_time_proportion(time_proportion, should_release) end

--- Prevents this unit from routing until it takes a certain proportion of casualties. If a proportion of 0 is supplied then any previous monitor set up with fearless_until_casualties is cancelled and the unit is allowed to rout.
---@param proportion unary Proportion of unit at which it may rout. Value should be expressed as a unary e.g. 0.5 = 50% casualties.
---@param should_release boolean Set to true to release script control of this unit after fearless_until_casualties makes a change. Set this primarily if the unit is under player control.
function script_unit:fearless_until_casualties(proportion, should_release) end

--- Forces this unit to rout when it reaches a certain proportion of casualties. If a proportion of 0 is supplied then any previous monitor set up with rout_on_casualties is cancelled.
---@param unary_proportion number Proportion of unit hitpoints remaining at which it routs. Value should be expressed as a unary e.g. 0.6 = unit will rout when its health gets below 60%.
---@param set_invincible boolean Makes the unit invincible when it routs, so that it's guaranteed to survive.
function script_unit:rout_on_casualties(unary_proportion, set_invincible) end

--- Makes the subject unit invincible/fearless if it's not already routing.
---@param should_release boolean Set to true to release script control of this unit after invincible_if_standing makes a change. Set this primarily if the unit is under player control.
function script_unit:invincible_if_standing(should_release) end

--- Prevents the subject unit from rallying if it's already routing. Supply true as a single argument to start a monitor that will continually poll whether this unit is routing, and prevent it
---@param check_perpetually boolean If true is supplied instead, the function sets up a monitor that will continually poll the unit's routing status and, when found to be routing, prevents it from rallying at that time.
---@param shattered_only boolean Only count shattered units
---@param permit_rampaging boolean Don't automatically count rampaging units, check if they are actually routing too.
function script_unit:prevent_rallying_if_routing(check_perpetually, shattered_only, permit_rampaging) end

--- Stops any running monitor started by script_unit:prevent_rallying_if_routing.

function script_unit:morale_behavior_rout() end

--- Causes this unit to be subject to normal morale. This is an unembellished wrapper for an underlying code function.
function script_unit:morale_behavior_default() end

--- Makes the subject unit fearless if it's not already routing.
---@param should_release boolean Set to true to release script control of this unit after morale_behavior_fearless_if_standing makes a change. Set this primarily if the unit is under player control.
function script_unit:morale_behavior_fearless_if_standing(should_release) end

--- Makes the subject unit fearless if it's not already routing.
---@param should_release boolean Set to true to release script control of this unit after morale_behavior_default_if_standing makes a change. Set this primarily if the unit is under player control.
function script_unit:morale_behavior_default_if_standing(should_release) end

--- Calls unitcontroller:hide_unbreakable_in_ui to prevent or allow the UI to show that this unit is unbreakable. This is useful for scripted content which is altering whether a unit can rout or not but doesn't want this to be reflected on the user interface.
---@param hide_unbreakable_state boolean hide unbreakable state
function script_unit:hide_unbreakable_in_ui(hide_unbreakable_state) end

--- Instantly kills this unit.

--- Performs a disordered teleport of all units contained within this collection to within a radius around a position, both supplied. A disordered teleport preserves the current orientation and width of each unit, but teleports them within the radius of the position if they're not already inside.<br />
--- The function is intended to assist in transitions between different sections of gameplay within a heavily scripted battle. We may wish for the player to start the latter section with their troops in unformed order, akin to where they were at the end of the previous section, but to ensure that none of the player's forces are too far away from a known position (i.e. where we'd like them to start the latter section of gameplay).<br />

---@return boolean  is visible 
function script_units:is_visible_to_enemy() end

--- Deploys the units in this collection onto the battlefield in randomly-sized, randomly-timed batches. Units must have been scripted to not deploy automatically before this is called. Arguments can be used to influence the size and timing of the batches of units.
---@param min_units number Minimum size of random unit batch. Must be postive.
---@param max_units number Maximum size of random unit batch. Must be positive, and not less than the supplied min units value.
---@param min_period number Minimum time period between the arrival of batches in ms. Must be positive.
---@param max_period number Maximum time period between the arrival of batches in ms. Must be positive, and not less than the supplied minimum period.

---@param range number Range in m at which the enemy script_units begin to take casualties.
---@param casualties_proportion number Proportion of casualties taken per second. This should be specified as a unary proportion of the unit's initial strength, so the default value of 0.02 represents 2% of the initial strength per second.
function script_units:start_kill_aura(target_sunits, range, casualties_proportion) end

--- Stops the kill aura started on this collection with script_units:start_kill_aura.
function script_units:stop_kill_aura() end

--- Instructs this scriptunits collection to attack another, acting entirely under script control. This is best used for a close-quarters scripted engagement where no AI randomness or maneouvring is desired.
---@param enemy_script_units script_units enemy script_units
---@param should_run boolean should run
function script_units:attack_enemy_scriptunits(enemy_script_units, should_run) end

--- Stops an attack process started with script_units:attack_enemy_scriptunits.
function script_units:stop_attack_enemy_scriptunits() end

--- Pulses a highlight effect on all the unit cards associated with this scriptunits collection, using script_unit:highlight_unit_card.
---@param should_highlight boolean Set to true to turn the highlight effect on, false to turn it off.
---@param pulse_strength number Sets the strength of the pulse effect. A higher supplied value leads to a more pronounced pulse effect. The default value is 5.
---@param force_highlight boolean Overrides the disabling of help page highlighting with battle_ui_manager:set_help_page_link_highlighting_permitted. Set this to true if the script explicitly wants to highlight the UI cards when help page link highlighting is disabled (useful in tutorials).
function script_units:highlight_unit_cards(should_highlight, pulse_strength, force_highlight) end

--- Returns a string which represents the serialised state of this script_units collection. This does not embody the full model state of the units but only selected information. It is mainly intended for use by script_units:save_state_to_svr which will save the returned string into the scripted value registry. This string can then be loaded by <a href="../campaign/campaign_manager.html#function:campaign_manager:load_army_state_from_svr">campaign_manager:load_army_state_from_svr, allowing campaign scripts to spoof the results from a scripted battle that occurs mid-campaign flow.
---@return string  serialised state 
function script_units:serialise_state() end

--- Saves a string which represents the serialised state of this script_units collection to the scripted value registry. script_units:serialise_state is used to generate the state string, and core:svr_save_string is used to save the string. This is for use by scripts that wish to pass the state of an army, usually at the end of a battle, from battle script to campaign script, usually so that the latter can spoof the battle results in script. The function <a href="../campaign/campaign_manager.html#function:campaign_manager:load_army_state_from_svr">campaign_manager:load_army_state_from_svr can be used on the campaign-side to load the values saved by this string.
---@param name string Name for this svr entry, to be passed to core:svr_save_string.
function script_units:save_state_to_svr(name) end

--- Checks for a scriptedvalueregistry string with the supplied name, and attempts to apply the health values it contains to the units in this script_units collection. These svr strings would be set by either <a href="../campaign/campaign_manager.html#function:campaign_manager:save_army_state_to_svr">campaign_manager:save_army_state_to_svr in campaign or script_units:save_state_to_svr in battle.<br />
--- This is primarily intended to spoof casualties on a battle army that is coming from campaign, but where the army in battle is not logically related to that campaign army (for example, when loading from a campaign into a scripted xml battle).<br />
--- The function returns whether the application was successful. A successful application is one that modifies all units in the script_units collection (a "modification" from 100% health to 100% health would count), unless the allow_partial flag is set, in which case even a partial application would be considered successful. If the application is not successful then no changes are applied. Output is generated in all cases.
---@param name string Name of string saved in the scriptedvalueregistry.
---@param allow_partial boolean Allow a partial application of the state string. If this is set to true</code then the application will be successful even if not all sunits in this collection end up being touched.
---@return boolean  state was applied successfully 
function script_units:load_state_from_svr(name, allow_partial) end
