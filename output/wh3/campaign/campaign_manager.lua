---@class campaign_manager
local campaign_manager = {}

--- Creates and returns a campaign manager. If one has already been created it returns the existing campaign manager. Client scripts should not need to call this as it's already called, and a campaign manager set up, within the script libraries. However the script libraries cannot know the name of the campaign, so client scripts will need to set this using campaign_manager:set_campaign_name.
---@param campaign_name string? #optional, default value="" campaign name
---@return campaign_manager #campaign manager 
function campaign_manager:new(campaign_name) end

--- Sets the name of the campaign. This is used for some output, but is mostly used to determine the file path to the campaign script folder which is partially based on the campaign name. If the intention is to use campaign_manager:require_path_to_campaign_folder or campaign_manager:require_path_to_campaign_faction_folder to load in script files from a path based on the campaign name, then a name must be set first. The name may also be supplied to campaign_manager:new when creating the campaign manager.
---@param campaign_name string #campaign name
function campaign_manager:set_campaign_name(campaign_name) end

--- Returns the name of the campaign.
---@return string #campaign name 
function campaign_manager:get_campaign_name() end

--- Returns a static path to the campaign script folder (currently "data/script/campaign")
---@return string #campaign folder path 
function campaign_manager:get_campaign_folder() end

--- Adds the current campaign's folder to the path, so that the lua files related to this campaign can be loaded with the require command. This function adds the root folder for this campaign based on the campaign name i.e. script/campaign/%campaign_name%/, and also the factions subfolder within this. A name for this campaign must have been set with campaign_manager:new or campaign_manager:set_campaign_name prior to calling this function.
function campaign_manager:require_path_to_campaign_folder() end

--- Adds the player faction's script folder for the current campaign to the lua path (script/campaign/%campaign_name%/factions/%player_faction_name%/), so that scripts related to the faction can be loaded with the require command. Unlike campaign_manager:require_path_to_campaign_folder this can only be called after the game state has been created. A name for this campaign must have been set with campaign_manager:new or campaign_manager:set_campaign_name prior to calling this function.
function campaign_manager:require_path_to_campaign_faction_folder() end

--- This function attempts to load a lua script from all folders currently on the path, and, when loaded, sets the environment of the loaded file to match the global environment. This is used when loading scripts within a block (within if statement that is testing for the file's existence, for example) - loading the file with require would not give it access to the global environment.<br />
--- Call campaign_manager:require_path_to_campaign_folder and/or campaign_manager:require_path_to_campaign_faction_folder if required to include these folders on the path before loading files with this function, if required. Alternatively, use campaign_manager:load_local_faction_script for a more automated method of loading local faction scripts.<br />
--- If the script file fails to load cleanly, a script error will be thrown.
---@param script_name string #script name
---@param single_player_only boolean? #optional, default value=false single player only
function campaign_manager:load_global_script(script_name, single_player_only) end

--- Loads a script file in the factions subfolder that corresponds to the name of the local player faction, with the supplied string appellation attached to the end of the script filename. This function is the preferred method for loading in local faction-specific script files. It calls campaign_manager:require_path_to_campaign_faction_folder internally to set up the path, and uses campaign_manager:load_global_script to perform the loading. It must not be called before the game is created.
---@param script_name_appellation string #script name appellation
---@return boolean #file loaded successfully 
function campaign_manager:load_local_faction_script(script_name_appellation) end

--- Loads all lua script files with filenames that contain the supplied string from the target directory. This is used to load in exported files e.g. export_ancillaries.lua, as the asset graph system may create additional files with an extension of this name for each DLC, where needed (e.g. export_ancillaries_dlcxx.lua). The target directory is "script" by default.
---@param filename string #Filename subset of script file(s) to load.
---@param path string? #optional, default value="script" Path of directory to load script files from, from working data. This should be supplied without leading or trailing "/" separators.
function campaign_manager:load_exported_files(filename, path) end

--- Adds a linear sequence configuration. All added linear sequences will be queried when campaign_manager:load_linear_sequence_configuration is called, with one being picked and loaded based on the game state.<br />
--- The name, svr boolean, and tweaker name (where set) of each configuration must be unique compared to other configurations.
---@param name string #Script name for this configuration. This must not contain spaces. The name of a saved value which gets saved with the campaign is derived from this name.
---@param filename string #Appellation of script file to be passed to campaign_manager:load_local_faction_script (which performs the actual script loading) if this configuration is chosen by campaign_manager:load_linear_sequence_configuration.
---@param svr_bool string #Name of a scripted value registry boolean which, if set, causes this configuration to be loaded. When the transition from some other configuration to this configuration is desired, the game scripts should set this boolean value to true with ScriptedValueRegistry:SaveBool. The next time the campaign scripts load and campaign_manager:load_linear_sequence_configuration, this configuration will be chosen. Once chosen in this manner, the svr boolean is set back to false again.
---@param is_default boolean? #optional, default value=false Make this the default configuration if no other is chosen. Only one default configuration may be set.
---@param tweaker string? #optional, default value=false Name of tweaker value which, if set, forces this configuration to be chosen for loading. This is used for debugging scripts and forcing the game to start in a particular configuration.
function campaign_manager:add_linear_sequence_configuration(name, filename, svr_bool, is_default, tweaker) end

--- Picks a configuration previously added with campaign_manager:add_linear_sequence_configuration and loads it, based on certain values:<br />
--- The function first looks at svr boolean values for each configuration. If one is set then that configuration is chosen, and the boolean is set back to false. These booleans should be individually set to true by client scripts when they wish to transition from loading scripts in one configuration to another.<br />
--- If no svr boolean is set and it's a new game, the function checks the value of the tweaker specified by each configuration. If any tweaker is set then that configuration is loaded.<br />
--- If no svr boolean is set and it's a not a new game, the function checks to see if a saved value exists corresponding to any configuration. If one is found then that configuration is loaded.<br />
--- If no configuration has been loaded so far then a registry value derived from the name of each configuration is checked, which would indicate that the handler has been forceably reset. If any configuration matches then that configuration is loaded.<br />
--- If still no configuration has been loaded then all configurations are checked to see if there's a default. If there is a default configuration then it is loaded.
function campaign_manager:load_linear_sequence_configuration() end

--- Adds a callback to be called when the LoadingGame event is received from the game. This callback will be able to load information from the savegame with campaign_manager:load_named_value. See also campaign_manager:add_saving_game_callback and campaign_manager:save_named_value to save the values that will be loaded here.<br />
--- Note that it is preferable for client scripts to use this function rather than listen for the LoadingGame event themselves as it preserves the ordering of certain setup procedures.
---@param callback function #Callback to call. When calling this function the campaign manager passes it a single context argument, which can then be passed through in turn to campaign_manager:load_named_value.
function campaign_manager:add_loading_game_callback(callback) end

--- Loads a named value from the savegame. This may only be called as the game is being loaded, and must be passed the context object supplied by the LoadingGame event. Values are saved and loaded from the savegame with a string name, and the values themselves can be a boolean, a number, a string, or a table containing booleans, numbers or strings.
---@param value_name string #Value name. This must be unique within the savegame, and should match the name the value was saved with, with campaign_manager:save_named_value.
---@param default_value any #Default value, in case the value could not be loaded from the savegame. The default value supplied here is used to determine/must match the type of the value being loaded.
---@param context userdata #Context object supplied by the LoadingGame event.
function campaign_manager:load_named_value(value_name, default_value, context) end

--- Retrieves a value saved using the saved value system. Values saved using campaign_manager:set_saved_value are added to an internal register within the campaign manager, and are automatically saved and loaded with the game, so there is no need to register callbacks with campaign_manager:add_loading_game_callback or campaign_manager:add_saving_game_callback. Once saved with campaign_manager:set_saved_value, values can be accessed with this function.<br />
--- Values are stored and accessed by a string name. Values can be booleans, numbers or strings.
---@param value_name string #value name
---@return any #value 
function campaign_manager:get_saved_value(value_name) end

--- Retrieves or generates a value saved using the saved value system. When called, the function looks up a value by supplied name using campaign_manager:get_saved_value. If it exists it is returned, but if it doesn't exist a supplied function is called which generates the cached value. This value is saved with the supplied name, and also returned. A value is generated the first time this function is called, therefore, and is retrieved from the savegame on subsequent calls with the same arguments. If the supplied function doesn't return a value, a script error is triggered.
---@param value_name string #value name
---@param generator_callback function #generator callback
---@return any #value 
function campaign_manager:get_cached_value(value_name, generator_callback) end

--- Registers a callback to be called when the game is being saved. The callback can then save individual values with campaign_manager:save_named_value.
---@param callback function #Callback to call. When calling this function the campaign manager passes it a single context argument, which can then be passed through in turn to campaign_manager:save_named_value.
function campaign_manager:add_saving_game_callback(callback) end

--- Add a callback to be called after the game has been saved. These callbacks are called last in the saving sequence, and only the first time the game is saved after they have been added.
---@param callback function #Callback to call. When calling this function the campaign manager passes it a single context argument.
function campaign_manager:add_post_saving_game_callback(callback) end

--- Saves a named value from the savegame. This may only be called as the game is being saved, and must be passed the context object supplied by the SavingGame event. Values are saved (and loaded) from the savegame with a string name, and the values themselves can be a boolean, a number, a string, or a table containing booleans, numbers or strings.
---@param value_name string #Value name. This must be unique within the savegame, and will be used by campaign_manager:load_named_value later to load the value.
---@param value any #Value to save.
---@param context userdata #Context object supplied by the SavingGame event.
function campaign_manager:save_named_value(value_name, value, context) end

--- Sets a value to be saved using the saved value system. Values saved using this function are added to an internal register within the campaign manager, and are automatically saved and loaded with the game, so there is no need to register callbacks with campaign_manager:add_loading_game_callback or campaign_manager:add_saving_game_callback. Once saved with this function, the value can be accessed at any time with campaign_manager:get_saved_value.<br />
--- Values are stored and accessed by a string name. Values can be of type boolean, number, string or table, where that table itself contains only booleans, numbers, string or other tables. Repeated calls to set_saved_value with the same name are legal, and will just overwrite the value of the value stored with the supplied name.
---@param value_name string #Value name.
---@param value any #Value. Can be a boolean, number, string or table.
function campaign_manager:set_saved_value(value_name, value) end

--- Instructs the campaign game to save at the next opportunity. An optional completion callback may be supplied.
---@param callback function? #optional, default value=nil Completion callback. If supplied, this is called when the save procedure is completed.
---@param lock_afterwards boolean? #optional, default value=false Lock saving functionality after saving is completed.
function campaign_manager:save(callback, lock_afterwards) end

--- Registers a function to be called when the UI is created. Callbacks registered with this function will be called regardless of what mode the campaign is being loaded in.
---@param callback function #callback
function campaign_manager:add_ui_created_callback(callback) end

--- Registers a function to be called when the ui is created in a new singleplayer game.
---@param callback function #callback
function campaign_manager:add_ui_created_callback_sp_new(callback) end

--- Registers a function to be called when the ui is created in any singleplayer game.
---@param callback function #callback
function campaign_manager:add_ui_created_callback_sp_each(callback) end

--- Registers a function to be called when the ui is created in a new multiplayer game. Be sure not to make any calls to the model from within this callback.
---@param callback function #callback
function campaign_manager:add_ui_created_callback_mp_new(callback) end

--- Registers a function to be called when the ui is created in any multiplayer game. Be sure not to make any calls to the model from within this callback.
---@param callback function #callback
function campaign_manager:add_ui_created_callback_mp_each(callback) end

--- Registers a function to be called before any other first tick callbacks. Callbacks registered with this function will be called regardless of what mode the campaign is being loaded in.
---@param callback function #callback
function campaign_manager:add_pre_first_tick_callback(callback) end

--- Registers a function to be called when the first tick occurs. Callbacks registered with this function will be called regardless of what mode the campaign is being loaded in.
---@param callback function #callback
function campaign_manager:add_first_tick_callback(callback) end

--- Registers a function to be called when the first tick occurs, but after any other first tick callbacks. Callbacks registered with this function will be called regardless of what mode the campaign is being loaded in.
---@param callback function #callback
function campaign_manager:add_post_first_tick_callback(callback) end

--- Registers a function to be called when the first tick occurs in a new singleplayer game.
---@param callback function #callback
function campaign_manager:add_first_tick_callback_sp_new(callback) end

--- Registers a function to be called when the first tick occurs in a singleplayer game, whether new or loaded from a savegame.
---@param callback function #callback
function campaign_manager:add_first_tick_callback_sp_each(callback) end

--- Registers a function to be called when the first tick occurs in a new multiplayer game.
---@param callback function #callback

--- Registers a function to be called when the first tick occurs in a new game, whether singleplayer or multiplayer.
---@param callback function #callback
function campaign_manager:add_first_tick_callback_new(callback) end

--- Sets up defines common behaviour for intro cutscenes that factions scripts can use invoke of defining their own behaviour manually. In singleplayer mode, an intro cutscene will be started when the loading screen is dismised that will play the supplied cindyscene. In multiplayer mode, the camera is positioned at the default camera position. In both cases the script event ScriptEventIntroCutsceneFinished event is triggered when the sequence completes.
---@param default_camera_position table #Default camera position. This should be a lua table containing x, y, d, b and h fields.
---@param cindy_path string? #optional, default value=nil Path to cindy scene to play. If no cindy scene is specified then a placeholder non-cindy cutscene will be shown with a duration of 3 seconds.
---@param advice_keys table? #optional, default value=nil Table of advice keys that may be played within the cutscene.
---@param end_callback function? #optional, default value=nil End callback. If a function is supplied here, it will be called when the intro cutscene ends;
---@param cutscene_configurator function? #optional, default value=nil Cutscene configurator callback. If a function is supplied here, it will be called after the intro cutscene is declared but before campaign_cutscene:start is called, and will be passed the campaign_cutscene as a single argument. The function can therefore make configuration calls to the cutscene before it starts. This is useful if nonstandard behaviour for the cutscene is desired.
---@param movie string? #optional, default value=nil Pre-cindyscene fullscreen movie to play, if one is desired. This should be a key from the videos table.
---@param hide_faction_leader number? #optional, default value=false Hide the faction leader's character model while the intro cutscene is playing. If the boolean value true is supplied here, or 0, the faction leader's model will be hiddent at the start of the cutscene and unhidden at the end. If a positive number is supplied they will be hidden at the start, and then unhidden that many seconds in to the cutscene (or when the cutscene is skipped, whichever comes first).
function campaign_manager:setup_campaign_intro_cutscene(default_camera_position, cindy_path, advice_keys, end_callback, cutscene_configurator, movie, hide_faction_leader) end

--- Returns true if the campaign is multiplayer.
---@return boolean #is multiplayer campaign 
function campaign_manager:is_multiplayer() end

--- Returns true if the campaign is new. A campaign is "new" if it has been saved only once before - this save occurs during startpos processing.<br />
--- Note that if the script fails during startpos processing, the counter will not have been saved and it's value will be 0 - in this case, the game may report that it's not new when it is. If you experience a campaign that behaves as if it's loading into a savegame when starting from fresh, it's probably because the script failed during startpos processing.

function campaign_manager:model() end

--- Returns a handle to the raw episodic scripting interface. Generally it's not necessary to call this function, as calls made on the campaign manager which the campaign manager doesn't itself provide are passed through to the episodic scripting interface, but a direct handle to the episodic scripting interface may be sought with this function if speed of repeated access.

--- Returns true if a battle sequence is currently happening. Scripts can query whether a battle sequence is happening to know whether to proceed with gameplay events that should only happen outside of a battle. In particular, campaign_manager:progress_on_battle_completed uses this mechanism to know when to trigger its callback.<br />
--- A battle sequence starts when the PendingBattle event is received, and ends when either the BattleCompleted event is received for battles not involving a human participant, or two seconds after the BattleCompletedCameraMove event is received if the battle did involve a human participant. It is safe to use in multiplayer, and also works for battles that aren't fought (withdrawal, maintain siege etc).
---@return boolean #battle is happening 
function campaign_manager:is_processing_battle() end

--- Returns whether a pending battle is active (i.e. we are immediately pre-battle or post-battle). If the pending battle is active the function will also return whether the battle has been fought (note however that on the first tick when returning from battle this will still be false).

---@return number #turn number 
function campaign_manager:turn_number() end

--- Sets a turn number modifier. This offsets the result returned by campaign_manager:turn_number by the supplied modifier. This is useful for campaign setups which include optional additional turns (e.g. one or two turns at the start of a campaign to teach players how to play the game), but still wish to trigger events on certain absolute turns. For example, some script may wish to trigger an event on turn five of a standard campaign, but this would be turn six if a one-turn optional tutorial at the start of the campaign was played through - in this case a turn number modifier of 1 could be set if not playing through the tutorial.
---@param modifier number #modifier
function campaign_manager:set_turn_number_modifier(modifier) end

--- This function uses CampaignUI.TriggerCampaignScriptEvent to trigger a UI event over the network which all clients receive. Once the event has been received from all clients then the progress callback is called. This can be used to progress the script in a synchronous manner in a multiplayer game only once an inherently-asynchronous event has been received. For example, a cutscene shown on multiple machines at once could be skipped on one machine and not another - progress_on_all_clients_ui_triggered can be used in this situation to only progress on all machines onces the cutscene has finished on all machines.<br />
--- The listening process associated with this function begins when the script is started, so it will pick up relevant events generated by progress_on_all_clients_ui_triggered() calls on remote machines even before progress_on_all_clients_ui_triggered() is called on this machine.
---@param name string #Name for this process by which it may optionally be cancelled.
---@param callback function #Progression callback.
function campaign_manager:progress_on_all_clients_ui_triggered(name, callback) end

--- Calls the supplied callback when the result of a multiplayer query is received from the network. Multiplayer queries allow the scripts on all machines in a multiplayer game to query information that normally on the script on one machine would have access to, such as advice history or the state of the UI.<br />
--- With each multiplayer query a faction key and some optional query data is specified. The query is run on the machine where the local player's faction matches the faction specified with the query. The results of the query are then broadcast with CampaignUI.TriggerCampaignScriptEvent for all machines in the multiplayer game to receive.<br />
--- A number of multiplayer queries are supported:<br />
--- CommandDescription<br />
--- all_advice_strings_seenReturns true if all the specified advice strings have been seen on the machine where the local player's faction matches the faction specified with the query. The query data should be a table containing a list of advice strings. The result of the query will be a boolean value.
--- any_advice_strings_seenReturns true if any of the specified advice strings have been seen on the machine where the local player's faction matches the faction specified with the query. The query data should be a table containing a list of advice strings. The result of the query will be a boolean value.
--- get_open_blocking_panelReturns the result of calling campaign_ui_manager:get_open_blocking_panel on the machine where the local player's faction matches the faction specified with the query. No query data is specified with this query. The result of the query will be a string panel name, or false if no panel is open.

---@param query_command string #Query command to run. See documentation above for a supported list of query commands.
---@param faction_key string #Faction key, from the factions database table. The query is run on the machine where the local player's faction matches this key.

--- Allows progress when a supplied condition function returns true, either at the point progress_on_event is called or when a specified script event is received. This mechanism allows scripts to progress if either a) a condition is true now or b) it will become true at some later point when an event is received.<br />
--- This function takes a condition callback, an event name, and a target callback. When progress_on_event is called the condition callback is immedidately checked - should it return true, the target callback is called and the function terminates. Should it not return true, a listener is set up for the supplied event - when that event is received, the condition is checked at that time also. The first time the event is received and the condition returns true, the target callback is called.<br />
--- When the event is received, the context for the event will be passed to the condition function. Be mindful that when the condition is first called (at the time that progress_on_event is called) no context object will be supplied, so the condition must cope with a context object being present or not.<br />
--- A name must also be supplied, with which the process may be terminated with campaign_manager:cancel_progress_on_event.
---@param name string #Name for this process, by which it may be cancelled.
---@param event string #Event to listen for.
---@param condition function #Condition callback, which should return true when the target callback should be called.

--- Adds a record which modifies or completely overrides a fought or autoresolved battle, if that battle happens within a certain supplied radius of a supplied campaign anchor position. Aspects of the battle may be specified, such as the loading screen and script to use, or the entire battle may be subsituted with an xml battle.<br />
--- If a pending battle sequence is already active, and the battle has been fought, then this call is deferred until after the battle is completed to avoid tampering with the running battle.

--- Starts a monitor for a faction which, on turn start for that faction, triggers a event with the faction and the region they control with the lowest public order attached. This is useful for advice scripts that may wish to know where the biggest public order problems for a faction are. This function will need to be called by client scripts each time the script starts.<br />
--- The event triggered is ScriptEventFactionTurnStartLowestPublicOrder, and the faction and region may be returned by calling faction() and region() on the context object supplied with it.

--- RegionRebels events are sent as a faction ends their turn but before the FactionTurnEnd event is received. If called, this function listens for RegionRebels events for the specified faction, then waits for the FactionTurnEnd event to be received and sends a separate event. This flow of events works better for advice scripts.<br />
--- The event triggered is ScriptEventRegionRebels, and the faction and region may be returned by calling faction() and region() on the context object supplied with it.

--- This fuction starts a listener for hero actions committed against a specified faction and sends out further events based on the outcome of those actions. It is of most use for listening for hero actions committed against a player faction.<br />
--- This function called each time the script starts for the monitors to continue running. Once started, the function triggers the following events:<br />
--- Event NameContext FunctionsDescriptionScriptEventAgentActionSuccessAgainstCharactercharactertarget_characterA foreign agent (character) committed a successful action against a character (target_character) of the subject faction.ScriptEventAgentActionFailureAgainstCharactercharactertarget_characterA foreign agent (character) failed when attempting an action against a character (target_character) of the subject faction.ScriptEventAgentActionSuccessAgainstCharactercharactergarrison_residenceA foreign agent (character) committed a successful action against a garrison residence (garrison_residence) of the subject faction.ScriptEventAgentActionFailureAgainstCharactercharactergarrison_residenceA foreign agent (character) failed when attempting an action against a garrison residence (garrison_residence) of the subject faction.

--- Shows a benchmark constructed from supplied parameters if benchmarking mode is active, otherwise calls a supplied callback which should continue the campaign as normal. The intention is for this to be called on or around the first tick, at a critical early point within the benchmark faction's script (each campaign benchmark being associated with a certain faction). If benchmark mode is currently set, this function plays the supplied cindy scene then quits the campaign. If benchmark mode is not set then the supplied callback is called - this should cause the campaign to continue as normal.<br />
--- An initial position for the camera prior to the cindy scene starting may be set with a set of five numerical arguments specifying camera co-ordinates. All five arguments must be supplied for the camera position to be used.<br />
--- A duration for the cindy scene may optionally be set. If a duration is not set then the 
---@param cindy_file function #Function to call if this campaign has not been loaded in benchmarking mode.
---@param cam_x string #Cindy file to show for the benchmark.
---@param cam_y number? #optional, default value=nil Start x position of camera.

--- Returns a string which represents the serialised state of the military force specified by the supplied military force cqi. This does not embody the full model state of the units but only selected information. It is mainly intended for use by campaign_manager:save_army_state_to_svr which will save the returned string into the scriptedvalueregistry.
---@param mf_cqi number #mf cqi
---@return string #serialised state 
function campaign_manager:serialise_army_state(mf_cqi) end

--- Saves a string which represents the serialised state of the military force specified by the supplied military force cqi to the scriptedvalueregistry. campaign_manager:serialise_army_state is used to generate the state string, and core:svr_save_string is used to save the string. This string can then be loaded by <a href="../battle/script_unit.html#function:script_units:load_state_from_svr">script_units:load_state_from_svr, allowing scripted battles loaded from a campaign, but not logically related to that campaign (e.g. an xml battle) to spoof the starting state of a battle army to be approximately the same as it was in the campaign.

--- Checks for a scriptedvalueregistry string with the supplied name, and attempts to apply the health values it contains to the units in the military force specified by the supplied cqi.

--- This is primarily intended to spoof casualties on a campaign army that is coming back from battle, but where the army in battle is not logically related to the army in campaign (such as when loading back from a scripted xml battle).<br />
--- The function returns whether the application was successful. A successful application is one that modifies all units in the military force (a "modification" from 100% health to 100% health would count), unless the allow_partial flag is set, in which case even a partial application would be considered successful. If the application is not successful then no changes are applied. Output is generated in all cases.
---@param name string #Name of string saved in the scriptedvalueregistry.
---@param mf_cqi number #CQI of military force to apply state to.
---@param allow_partial boolean? #optional, default value=false Allow a partial application of the state string. If this is set to true</code then the application will be successful even if not all units in the military force end up being touched.
---@return boolean #state was applied successfully
