---@param length number? #optional, default value=0 Length of the attached arrow pointer and line. Can be zero.
---@param ui_component any #UI component to point at. This can be supplied as either a uicomponent or a function that returns a uicomponent. By default the pointer will point to the middle of the component - use the offset parameters to change this.
---@param x_proportion number? #optional, default value=0.5 Unary x proportion specifying a pointed position relative to the dimensions of the specified component. Supply zero to point at the left edge of the component, one to point at the right edge of the component, or 0.5 to point at the middle of the component, for example. Values less than zero or greater than one are valid.
---@param y_proportion number? #optional, default value=0.5 Unary y proportion specifying a pointed position relative to the dimensions of the specified component. Supply zero to point at the top edge of the component, one to point at the bottom edge of the component, or 0.5 to point at the middle of the component, for example.

---@param name string #Name for the text pointer. Must be unique amongst text pointers.
---@param text_pointer text_pointer #Text pointer object to display relative to.
---@param x_offset number #x offset in pixels from the other text pointer. This takes into account the other text pointer's size, so the two text pointers cannot overlap. Supplying a value of 10 would mean a gap of 10 pixels between the two text pointers, with this text pointer on the right of the other, while a value of -10 would mean a gap of 10 pixels with this text pointer on the left.
---@param y_offset number #y offset in pixels from the other text pointer. This takes into account the other text pointer's size, so the two text pointers cannot overlap. Supplying a value of 10 would mean a gap of 10 pixels between the two text pointers, with this text pointer below the other (as a higher value of y means a position further down the screen), while a value of -10 would mean a gap of 10 pixels with this text pointer above the other.

function text_pointer:set_panel_width_to_screen(difference, shrink_horizontally) end

--- Sets the height in campaign, or height offset in battle, of the pointed position if the pointer is displayed in worldspace mode. This is important to set in campaign as the script has no way of determining the height of the terrain at a position in worldspace, so it must be supplied here. In battle, where the script can find the height of the terrain at a point, this sets the vertical offset from the ground.<br />
--- Without setting a height in campaign, a worldspace pointer will appear pointing to a height of 0 which will likely be beneath the terrain being pointed at.
---@param display_height number #display height

--- Without setting a label offset, the text label with be centred to the position being pointed at e.g. centred directly above it if the display mode is set to "bottom", centred to the left if the display mode is set to "right" etc. Set a label offset to move the label relative to this position.
---@param x_offset number #x offset
---@param y_offset number #y offset

---@param show_line_end_without_line boolean #show line end without line
function text_pointer:set_show_pointer_end_without_line(show_line_end_without_line) end

--- Sets the component priority of the text pointer. This determines what components the text pointer is drawn on top of, and what components it is drawn underneath.
---@param priority number #priority
function text_pointer:set_priority(priority) end

--- Sets the text pointer components to be topmost in the UI heirarchy.
---@param topmost boolean? #optional, default value=true topmost
function text_pointer:set_topmost(topmost) end

--- Sets the text pointer to pulse-highlight when it shows.
---@param pulse boolean? #optional, default value=true Set to true to enable pulsing.
---@param pulse_strength number? #optional, default value=nil Pulse strength override. Supply a positive number here to modify the strength of the pulse. Default value is 5.
function text_pointer:set_should_pulse(pulse, pulse_strength) end

--- Sets the text pointer to stream its text, and optionally sets the duration over which the text is to be streamed.
---@param should_stream boolean #should stream
---@param stream_duration number? #optional, default value=nil stream duration
function text_pointer:set_stream_by_char(should_stream, stream_duration) end

--- Sets just the duration over which the text is to be streamed.

function text_pointer:set_panel_state_override(state_name) end

--- Sets a different state for each line of text pointer panel. Any state set here must be present on the line component in the text pointer layout.
---@param state_name string #state name
function text_pointer:set_text_state_override(state_name) end

--- Sets a different state for the line end uicomponent. Any state set here must be present on the line_end component in the text_pointer_line_parent layout.
---@param state_name string #state name
function text_pointer:set_line_end_state_override(state_name) end

--- Shows a close button on the text pointer. By default a close button is not shown.
---@param show_button boolean? #optional, default value=true show button
function text_pointer:set_show_close_button(show_button) end

--- Hides the text pointer when the close button is clicked. By default, this is enabled, so the panel closes when the button is clicked.
---@param close_on_click boolean? #optional, default value=true close on click
function text_pointer:set_hide_on_close_button_clicked(close_on_click) end

--- Set a callback to call when the close button is clicked. An optional delay may also be set. Calling this also sets the close button to show.<br />
--- A callback set using this function will not be called if the text pointer is hidden by external script - use text_pointer:add_hide_callback to set a callback that would be called in this case.
---@param callback function #Callback
---@param delay number? #optional, default value=0 Delay before calling callback, in s (campaign) or ms (battle/frontend)
function text_pointer:set_close_button_callback(callback, delay) end

--- Set a callback to call when the text pointer is hidden. An optional delay may also be set. A further optional flag sets the close button to show.
---@param callback function #Callback
---@param delay number? #optional, default value=0 Delay before calling callback, in s (campaign) or ms (battle/frontend)
---@param show_close_button boolean? #optional, default value=nil Sets the close button to show on the text pointer. If no value is specified then the current behaviour remains untouched.
function text_pointer:add_hide_callback(callback, delay, show_close_button) end

--- Overrides the component to use as the close button, by name.
---@param component_name string #component name
function text_pointer:set_close_button_component(component_name) end

--- Instructs the text pointer to highlight the close button when it shows, with an optional delay between the time of showing and the time the close button is highlighted. Immediately highlights the close button if the text pointer is already showing.
---@param delay number? #optional, default value=0 Period the text pointer should wait after being shown before the button highlight begins. This is specified in s in campaign, ms in battle or the frontend. This is disregarded if the text pointer is already showing at the time this function is called.
function text_pointer:set_highlight_close_button(delay) end

--- Sets the text pointer to position itself/behave as a cutscene subtitle, in the lower cinematic bar. This is akin to setting the pointer display mode to "subtitle" in text_pointer:new.
---@param as_subtitle position? #optional, default value=true as subtitle
function text_pointer:set_position_as_subtitle(as_subtitle) end

--- Sets the text displayed by a specified child uicomponent of the text pointer to a localised value. Use this method to show customised text on the text pointer.

--- Adds a callback to call when the text pointer is shown with text_pointer:show.
---@param callback function #callback
function text_pointer:add_show_callback(callback) end

--- Makes the text pointer visible.
---@param display MILITARY_FORCE_SCRIPT_INTERFACE? #optional, default value=false Forces the text pointer to display. This flag is only considered if the text pointer has been set to behave as a subtitle with text_pointer:set_position_as_subtitle, and if set to true causes the text pointer to override the player's subtitles preferences.
function text_pointer:show(display) end

--- Hides the text pointer. Supply true as a single argument to hide it immediately and prevent it from animating.
---@param immediately hide? #optional, default value=false Hide the text pointer immediately without any animation.
---@param event suppress? #optional, default value=false Suppress the scripted event that triggers - this is for internal use.
function text_pointer:hide(immediately, event) end

--- Returns whether the text pointer is currently showing.
---@return boolean #is showing

---@param should_ignore boolean #should ignore
function text_pointer:ignore_hide_all_text_pointers(should_ignore) end

--- Set whether the escape key will be release when ignore text_pointer:hide() is called.
---@param should_stop_release boolean #should stop release
function text_pointer:do_not_release_escape_key(should_stop_release) end

--- Sets the style of this text pointer. Setting a style automatically sets a range of configuration options common to that style - inspect the script function to find out what exactly gets set or to add more styles.<br />
--- Multiple styles may be set on a given text pointer if the configuration options do not overlap (if they do then the later settings will overwrite the earlier settings).<br />
--- Currently-supported styles are:<br />
--- title_and_textSets the layout of the text pointer to "text_pointer_title_and_text". When setting this style the calling script must also supply two strings specifying the text db key of the title and the text to display.
--- text_onlySets the layout of the text pointer to "text_pointer_text_only". When setting this style the calling script must also supply a string specifying the text db key of the text to display.
--- topmostSets the pointer to be topmost and with a component priority of 1500.
--- semitransparentSets the "topmost" style and the panel state to "semitransparent".
--- semitransparent_highlightSets the "semitransparent" style and sets the close button to highlight two seconds after it is shown.
--- semitransparent_highlight_dont_closeSets the "semitransparent_highlight" style. The text pointer will not close when the close button is clicked, however.
--- subtitle_with_frameSets the pointer into subtitle mode with a frame.
--- activeSets the "topmost" style, and sets the panel into the appropriate visual style for the active text pointer interface.
--- minimalistSets the "minimalist" style but without a close button.

---@param x_proportion number? #optional, default value=0.5 Unary x proportion specifying a pointed position relative to the dimensions of the specified component. Supply 0 to point at the left edge of the component, 1 to point at the right edge of the component, or 0.5 to point at the middle of the component, for example. Values less than zero or greater than one are valid.

---@param width number? #optional, default value=250 Width of the text pointer panel in pixels.
---@param suppress_record boolean? #optional, default value=false Sets this active pointer to not record a record of whether it's been triggered in advice history. If this is set to true then the active pointer is not registered with the script core, and it doesn't need to have a unique name. However, the active pointer will not be able to automatically listen for events.

An optional flag specifies whether this hide should happen immediately, without any fade animation.
---@param event_name string #Script event name.
---@param condition function/boolean? #optional, default value=true Conditional check. This can be a function that returns a boolean, or true to always pass when the supplied event is received.
